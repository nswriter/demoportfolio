                <h1>The Natural Guide: The Joy of Nature and the Woes Without It
                </h1>
                <h2>Nicholas Silva | 2023</h2>
                <p>
                    Nature is often seen as a restorative force and a guide, and indeed this can be seen in both Coleridge's “This Lime-tree Bower my Prison” and Mary Shelley's <cite>Frankenstein</cite>. However, while “Bower” sees nature as a path out of a sense of despondent imprisonment,  Frankenstein's path is inverted, with nature cast aside for the ruin of human endeavors. 


                </p>
                <p>
                    Coleridge's poem is definitively less aggressive than Frankenstein, and thus is enabled with a full ability to appreciate nature. Laid up in a garden, unable to accompany his friends on a walk, the speaker laments at all they are not seeing. But as they assess their situation, they begin to understand that the beauty of nature is everywhere, and can thus be appreciated from where he sits. He observes that “`Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good / that we may lift the soul and contemplate / with lively joy” (Coleridge, 67-69). The absence of his original plans allowed him to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the joy of life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This joy, the speaker contends, is to be found in everything. The sight of birds, the sounds, the sun in the sky. Nature “may well employ / Each faculty of sense, and keep the heart / Awake to Love and Beauty!” (Coleridge, 64-66). And in appreciating this fullness of sense, and being attuned to the love and beauty of the world, the garden is no longer the prison. The garden is space enough for the speaker, and instead of feeling bad that he is not with his friends, he merely hopes that they are as attuned to the world as he has become. There is a great hope present, in these musings. It is an understanding that even in a sliver of green amidst civilization there is joy and hope, if one knows to look for it. Nature does not abandon, even if abandoned. It is a giver, and a restorative force.


                </p>
                <p>
                    However, nature is only kind if looked for. If the speaker of “Bower” had not pursued it, and looked for the joy, he would not have found it. Frankenstein shows the other side. Abandoned by every shred of civilization from the moment of his birth, the Creature is taught and nurtured by nature. When he was first wandering, he observed that “a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave [him] a sensation of pleasure… [he] gazed with a kind of wonder… [and] it enlightened [his] path” (Shelley, 103). The moonlight guided the Creature, it showed him the berries which fed him, the cloak which warmed him. It illuminated a gentle path through the harshness of the life he had been unceremoniously thrust into. There is utility to his appreciation of nature, its rejuvenating gift being that of ways to sustain his life. But he still revels in the wonder of it, too. The Creature is awakened to the “Love and Beauty” that Coleridge admires in nature. It isn't just a guide through life, but a guide on how to live, how to find peace and happiness. He could only see the world through a moonlit filter, but he still saw it, and enjoyed it just as well as any person, if not more, for he was not burdened by any judgment of it aside from instinctive appreciation. The Creature would not have likely needed a whole poem to reach this conclusion, it is a thought present from the start. He begins life regarding nature as a place of safety and rejuvenation, removed from the prison of the “civilized” world. The Creature is taught the joys of life in nature. He finds happiness in the birds, comfort in the sun. He finds food and is at peace. He doesn't turn to violence until he leaves nature, commanded by a need for human company, and revenge upon Victor. He is innocent in nature, corrupted by its absence. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Victor also begins his narrative with a sense of the joy of nature, or at least the safety of it. When he is confronted by the fruits of his labor, he flees his responsibilities and takes a walk until he is calm enough to sleep. Later, after seeing the horrors that this lapse caused, he takes a hike into the mountains. Here the “sublime and magnificent scenes afforded [him] the greatest consolation that [he] was capable of receiving. They elevated [him] from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove [his] grief, they subdued and tranquillised it” (Shelley, 96). Victor uses nature to escape the stress and horror of his work and the tragedy surrounding him. It is a rejuvenating force to his shaken being, a reminder of the majestic and imposing laws of existence. The true natural wonder, he is reminded, is beautiful, and his flagrant overstepping of its rules caused an unnatural pain.

                <p>
                    However, unlike the risk-free musings of the erudite speaker in “Bower”, the nature of Frankenstein is also a place of danger. After disposing of the Creature's bride, Frankenstein takes a moment at sea. As he watches, “the sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed [him] and filled me with such agreeable sensations… the murmur lulled [him], and in a short time [he] slept soundly.” (Shelley, 171). As Frankenstein has already learned, nature is a font of beauty and wonder, but does have harsh and immovable rules which must be obeyed, or else consequences follow. It is a guide, but guidance must be heeded to result in its full potential. Here, Frankenstein ignores the guidance of nature, and finds a momentary rejuvenation at the risk of great peril. Not only does he almost get lost at sea, but, with this long detour, returns to shore far from where he started, far later than expected. He is confused for the Creature, and framed for the murder of his friend Henry. There lies the peril of nature in Frankenstein: once scorned, once ignored, it can entertain great danger. Frankenstein's walk at the start was not enough nature to rejuvenate his senses after spending so long ignoring its pleas. He offended it, ignored it, and set in motion the grim narrative before him. The Creature, raised by nature, turns his back on it with ideas of revenge, straying into civilization and incurring violence. Time and time again the characters turn their backs to the wonder and the guidance of nature, and seek their own ends which are set against it. Instead of freeing themselves from a prison through an understanding of nature, they build one for themselves. 


                </p>
                <p>
                    Nature is a rejuvenating force, as these characters discover. Unfortunately, only the speaker of “This Lime-tree Bower my Prison” is able to be freed by this knowledge, as he chooses to listen, instead of falling inwards into his own frets. Frankenstein and the Creature turn their backs to nature, and thus rob themselves of its gifts, of its joy, and ultimately of each other's lives.
