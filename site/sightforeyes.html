                <h1>A Sight for Weary Eyes</h1>
                <h2>Nicholas Silva | 2024</h2>
                <p>
                    Windows were almost an entirely romantic notion on a deep space hauler. All there was to see was the inky black expanding evermore around you, the stars and nebulas glittering like gems at distances too vast to fathom. You couldn't see anything, really. Not until you were right up to it. Sensors were the eyes of a ship's crew.

                </p>
                <p>
                    But still, sitting alone -and space let you know just how alone you were- it was nice to have something beautiful to look at. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was thus that Reid and Iris found themselves sitting on a too-hard metal bench, arms propped against the frames of one of the port-side portholes, staring out into the void. The ship hummed around them, but they were silent. They were three months into a five month long journey, and sometimes words simply failed to arise at that point.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the silence was perfectly comforting, just knowing that there was someone else sharing in it.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Reid looked over at Iris, bathed in the soft bluish glow of the technical display sat across the room from them. The light danced as the readouts changed, ebbing and flowing, and it looked like they were in some underwater world. Which, he mused, rubbing his temple lightly, he supposed they kind of were.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the dense, reassuring wall of the ship's hull, he gazed at the constellations. Crabs, dolphins, a martini glass. He laughed at the last one, and nudged Iris, who gave a small grin. They were a long way from home to see that one, in fact it was a sight that few saw in this new era of highly efficient warp travel. They were in a region of space almost devoid of planets, of civilization. A vast interstellar highway that was, for all intents and purposes, abandoned. Occasionally they'd glide past the derelict hulk of an old fuel depot, but they'd never seen another soul out here. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Their cargo, highly unstable crystals mined in one of humanity's secret colonies, became disastrously volatile at any speeds above a moderate faster-than-lightspeed. Warp was out of the question. Instead, they were transported in long-haul freighters like theirs, relics of a bygone era of burgeoning space travel. Their travels across these wastelands would take a modern ship days at most, hours more typically. But for them it was months. Five months, two people, and a ship that was just itching to explode.

        <h2>Info About this Story:</h2>
        <p>I wrote <cite>Sight for Weary Eyes</cite> for my Winter session of English 355, Creative Writing, in January of 2024. As with <cite>Space Haulers</cite>, also featured in my portfolio, I was inspired by the winter landscape around me. This story is based on an adapted setting from a D&D campaign I ran with my freinds and other classmates as part of a club in high school. I wanted to write something that was ominous, but still had hope, and so I settled on a protagonist navigating a changing, dangerous town to see a great natural wonder.</p>
