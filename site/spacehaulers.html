                <h1>Space Haulers</h1>
                <h2>Nicholas Silva | 2024</h2>
                <p>
                    Windows were almost an entirely romantic notion on a deep space hauler. All there was to see was the inky black expanding evermore around you, the stars and nebulas glittering like gems at distances too vast to fathom. You couldn't see anything, really. Not until you were right up to it. Sensors were the eyes of a ship's crew.

                </p>
                <p>
                    But still, sitting alone -and space let you know just how alone you were- it was nice to have something beautiful to look at. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was thus that Reid and Iris found themselves sitting on a too-hard metal bench, arms propped against the frames of one of the port-side portholes, staring out into the void. The ship hummed around them, but they were silent. They were three months into a five month long journey, and sometimes words simply failed to arise at that point.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the silence was perfectly comforting, just knowing that there was someone else sharing in it.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Reid looked over at Iris, bathed in the soft bluish glow of the technical display sat across the room from them. The light danced as the readouts changed, ebbing and flowing, and it looked like they were in some underwater world. Which, he mused, rubbing his temple lightly, he supposed they kind of were.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the dense, reassuring wall of the ship's hull, he gazed at the constellations. Crabs, dolphins, a martini glass. He laughed at the last one, and nudged Iris, who gave a small grin. They were a long way from home to see that one, in fact it was a sight that few saw in this new era of highly efficient warp travel. They were in a region of space almost devoid of planets, of civilization. A vast interstellar highway that was, for all intents and purposes, abandoned. Occasionally they'd glide past the derelict hulk of an old fuel depot, but they'd never seen another soul out here. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Their cargo, highly unstable crystals mined in one of humanity's secret colonies, became disastrously volatile at any speeds above a moderate faster-than-lightspeed. Warp was out of the question. Instead, they were transported in long-haul freighters like theirs, relics of a bygone era of burgeoning space travel. Their travels across these wastelands would take a modern ship days at most, hours more typically. But for them it was months. Five months, two people, and a ship that was just itching to explode.

        <h2>Info About this Story:</h2>
        <p>I wrote <cite>Space Haulers</cite> for my Winter session of English 355, Creative Writing, in January of 2024. Surrounded by the beautiful desolation of the barren, slumbering New England landscape I was inspired to write something about isolation. I personally love exploring the outdoors, esspecially on a nice snowy day. I also love eldrich horror (from a distance, though, preferably!), but didn't want to write something <em>too</em> dark. I wanted some hope.</p>
        <p>I started out thinking of the everlooming job search as I was, thinking about how I could leverage all of these factors. I knew I wanted to write something about employees being put on the line for the "bottom line", something that would put them up against some horror or another. My original idea proved to be too ambitious for the limited window I had to write the story, and so I pivoted. This was the result.</p>
